# Uppy
An instant file uploading tool for quick and efficient public distribution

This program is still in it's early shoes and doesn't have much to offer yet, however the basic and initial methods are implemented and working:


In order to test the working methods you have to first select a Folder on the "Local copy folder".
Under the HotKeys tab you can define the hotkeys for the required actions.

The uploading system hasn't been implemented yet. I am probably going to use a PHP api that fetches pushes information/files from/to the server.
